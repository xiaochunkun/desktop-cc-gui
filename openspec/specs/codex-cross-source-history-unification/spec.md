# codex-cross-source-history-unification Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change fix-codex-source-switch-runtime-apply-2026-03-31. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Codex Thread History MUST Be Unified Across Sources Per Workspace
For the same workspace scope, Codex history list MUST aggregate entries across available sources/providers and present them in one default view.

#### Scenario: aggregate live and local entries into one list
- **WHEN** thread list is requested for a workspace
- **THEN** system MUST aggregate active-source live thread list and workspace-scoped local Codex session summaries
- **AND** system MUST return a single unified list instead of source-separated lists

#### Scenario: source switch does not hide old history by default
- **WHEN** user has history generated under source A and source B, and current active source is B
- **THEN** entries from source A MUST remain visible in unified list
- **AND** user MUST NOT need app restart or source rollback to view source A history entries

### Requirement: Unified History MUST Preserve Source Identity Metadata
Unified history entries MUST include source/provider identity metadata for UI labeling and diagnostics.

#### Scenario: unified entry exposes source metadata
- **WHEN** an entry is returned by unified history list
- **THEN** entry payload MUST include non-empty source/provider identity field when available
- **AND** frontend MAY render this as source badge without altering entry identity

#### Scenario: unified entry includes source label and size metadata when available
- **WHEN** unified list entry can be enriched from local session summary
- **THEN** entry payload SHOULD expose `sourceLabel` for compact source/provider display
- **AND** entry payload SHOULD expose `sizeBytes` for thread size visibility in list UI

### Requirement: Unified History MUST Apply Deterministic Deduplication And Ordering
Aggregation MUST produce stable list behavior under repeated refresh and mixed-source duplicates.

#### Scenario: duplicate entry candidates are merged deterministically
- **WHEN** same logical session/thread appears from multiple aggregated sources
- **THEN** system MUST keep one canonical list entry by deterministic merge rules
- **AND** canonical selection MUST be repeatable across identical inputs

#### Scenario: unified list ordering is stable by recency
- **WHEN** unified list is returned with mixed-source entries
- **THEN** entries MUST be sorted by deterministic recency rule (newest first)
- **AND** repeated fetch without data change MUST keep identical order

### Requirement: Unified History MUST Degrade Gracefully
Failure in one source path MUST NOT collapse entire history list response.

#### Scenario: live thread/list fails but local aggregate succeeds
- **WHEN** active-source live `thread/list` request fails
- **THEN** system MUST still return local aggregated history entries when available
- **AND** response MUST indicate fallback/partial-source condition for diagnostics

#### Scenario: local scan fails but live thread/list succeeds
- **WHEN** local session scan path fails
- **THEN** system MUST still return live thread entries
- **AND** system MUST NOT return empty list solely due to local scan failure

### Requirement: Unified History MUST Preserve Known Sessions Under Local-Scan Degradation
When local session scan is unavailable, unified history MUST keep already-known workspace session continuity and expose explicit degradation marker.

#### Scenario: local scan unavailable reuses cached known session identities
- **WHEN** local session scan fails for current workspace
- **AND** system has cached known session identifiers from previous successful scans
- **THEN** unified history merge MUST reuse cached identifiers to keep relevant live entries visible
- **AND** response MUST include `partialSource = "local-session-scan-unavailable"` for diagnostics

#### Scenario: degradation marker clears after local scan recovery
- **WHEN** a subsequent local scan succeeds
- **THEN** system MUST refresh known session identifiers from latest local summaries
- **AND** response MUST NOT keep stale `partialSource` degradation marker
